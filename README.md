The scRNA-seq data essential for the results presented in this study can be accessed on GitHub at the following link: https://github.com/ttgump/scDeepCluster/tree/master/scRNA-seq%20data.

For code availability, the source code, pretrained model weights, and the actual scRNA-seq data utilized in the experiments conducted with scDeepCluster are also accessible on GitHub: https://github.com/ttgump/scDeepCluster.

My role involves comprehending the authors' work, evaluating their findings, and comparing them with classical clustering methods.

# This code is adapted from [Tian Tian 1,3, Ji Wan2,3, Qi Song2 and Zhi Wei 1*]'s work as described in the paper:
# Clustering single-cell RNA-seq data with a model-based deep learning approach
# Original code repository: (https://github.com/ttgump/scDeepCluster.)
# Modifications have been made to suit the current use case.
